# TakeDown-Mechanic-Source-File
The source code containing the functionality of executing take down moves on enemies from the student project "Capstan Gate" I was apart of at Toronto Film School.

I created a video tutorial that walks through all of the code and execution here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olcAh_hQsW0&t=543s

NOTE: This is just the source code and not the project. It will contain all the logic for the player and enemy to perform takedowns
